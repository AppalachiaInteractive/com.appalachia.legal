# Our Team

## Chris Schubert

Chris was born in Amherst, New York but grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  He's thankful for his parents, Mark and Christine.  He loves learning about and exploring just about everything in nature - especially trees, rocks, water, animals, fungii, bacteria, and moss.  He tries his hardest, does his best to take less than he gives, and hopes to leave the world a better place than he found it.

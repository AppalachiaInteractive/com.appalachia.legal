Chris was born near Niagara Falls, New York and grew up along the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  He's thankful for his parents, Mark and Christine.  He loves learning about and exploring just about everything in nature â€” especially trees, rocks, water, animals, mushrooms, bacteria, and moss.  He tries his hardest, does his best, and hopes to leave the world a better place than he found it.

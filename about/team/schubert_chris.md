Chris was born near Niagara Falls, New York and grew up along the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  He's thankful for his parents, Christine and Mark, and inspired by his siblings, Erin and Taylor.  He loves learning about and exploring just about everything in nature â€” especially trees, rocks, water, animals, mushrooms, bacteria, moss - and most recently, slugs!  He tries his hardest, does his best, and hopes to leave the world a better place than he found it.  He's also more of a goofball than this bio suggests.

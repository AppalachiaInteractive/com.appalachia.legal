Janice was born and raised in Pittsburgh, PA, but spent her summers building bonfires, swimming, and turning wild berries into jam with her sisters at her parents' cabin just 40 miles west of the Allegheny National Forest. Those barefoot summers instilled a lifelong respect for Pennsylvania's incredible forests and a sense of personal responsibility to reduce her impact on the diverse wildlife that calls them home. She loves discovering new ways to renew and deepen this appreciation including hiking, biking, camping, and, most recently, trying desperately to bribe vegetables to grow in her tiny urban backyard.

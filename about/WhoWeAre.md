# Who we are

Hi.  We're Appalachia Interactive.

We're a small, independent video game studio based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania — near the confluence of the Monongahela, Allegheny, and Ohio rivers, nestled in the Appalachian Plateau, just west of the Allegheny Mountains, on the western side of the Appalachian Mountains.

We’re currently working on our first release — "Keepers of Creation".  Here's a bit about what matters to us.

## Independence

Appalachia Interactive is not, and does not aim to be, a traditional video game studio.  Or, for that matter, a traditional company.  We're going our own way — staying small, lean, and employee-owned.  

Send us a note at [inquiries@appalachiainteractive.com](mailto:inquiries@appalachiainteractive.com) if you want to engage with what we're doing in any way.

## Responsibility

We don't ignore our ethical, moral, and social responsibilities.  We take it seriously when we represent something in our work — a living being, a place, a culture.  We recognize that the elements of our world that make their way into our stories, are owed something by us.

If you want to learn about how we are repaying this debt now, and how we plan to in the future, check out our [causes](https://appalachiainteractive.com/causes).

## Accessibility

We dont't cut corners on accessibility.  If you aren't able to play our games, please reach out to us at [accessibility@appalachiainteractive.com](mailto:accessibility@appalachiainteractive.com) and we will do everything we can to accomodate you.  You can read more about our accessibility efforts [here](https://appalachiainteractive.com/accessibility).

## Respect

We do our best to offer our respect to those who lived on this land before us, and to repay them for what was taken.  You can read more about that [here](https://appalachiainteractive.com/causes/native-peoples/).

Pittsburgh sits on land previously occupied for thousands of years by native peoples, in a region the **`Seneca`** referred to as `Dionde:gâ`.  Their history can be glimpsed by taking a look at the names of our rivers, towns, and geological features.  

Let's revisit the description of our location above:

> near the confluence of the `Monongahela`, `Allegheny`, and `Ohio` rivers, nestled in the `Appalachian` Plateau, just west of the `Allegheny` Mountains, on the western side of the `Appalachian` Mountains.

### The Three Rivers

> near the confluence of the `Monongahela`, `Allegheny`, and `Ohio` rivers

#### Monongahela

The **`Unami`** word `Monongahela` means *"`falling banks`"*, in reference to the geological instability of the river's banks.

#### Allegheny

From the **`Lenape/Unami`** `welhìk` (*"`good`"*) + `hane` (*"`river`"* (in compounds)).

#### Ohio

From the Seneca word `ohiːyo'`, meaning *"`good river`"*, *"`great river`"*, or *"`large creek`"*.

### Appalachia

> nestled in the `Appalachian` Plateau

`Apalachee` is a **`Muskogean`** language, related to other languages like **`Choctaw`** and **`Creek`**.  The `Appalachian` place-name was recorded during the Narváez Expedition's encounter in 1528 with the **`Tocobaga`**, who spoke of a country named `Apalachen` far to the north.

These Native American languages, a critical part of the history of our land, are dying.  Please consider researching the native peoples from your area.  They may have a language preservation program that is in need of your assistance.

## Commitment

We want to create works that deeply engages our audience.  Money is not the sole focus of our studio.  There are no ads, no micro-transactions, no pay-to-win, no subscriptions.  We're awake at night thinking about how to make our work more meaningful — not how to part our audience with their money.

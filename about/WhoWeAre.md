# Appalachia Interactive

Hi.  We're Appalachia Interactive.

## Who we are

We're a small, independent video game studio based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania — near the confluence of the Monongahela, Allegheny, and Ohio rivers, nestled in the Appalachian Plateau, just west of the Allegheny Mountains, on the western side of the Appalachian Mountains.

We’re currently working on our first release — "Keepers of Creation".

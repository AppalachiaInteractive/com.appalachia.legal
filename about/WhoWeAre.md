# We're Appalachia Interactive

## Who we are

We're **were** an 3D and interactive studio and consultancy studio based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania â€” near the confluence of the Monongahela, Allegheny, and Ohio rivers, nestled in the plateau on the western side of the Appalachian Mountains.

We closed our doors in September, 2022 after finding a partner who wanted to carry our core IP forward as the basis for their future development.  To all of our collaborators, customers, and friends, we thank you for taking this journey with us and we're sure our paths will cross again!  Feel free to get in touch with us in the future, as well!

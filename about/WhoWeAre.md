# Who we are

Hi.  We're Appalachia Interactive.

We're a small, independent video game studio based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania — nestled in the Appalachian Plateau, just west of the Allegheny Mountains, on the western side of the Appalachian Mountains.

 We’re currently working on our first release — "Keepers of Creation".  Here's a bit about who we are and what matters to us.

## Independent

Appalachia Interactive is not, and does not aim to be, a traditional video game studio.  Or, for that matter, a traditional company.  We're going our own way — staying small, lean, and employee-owned.  

Send us a note at [inquiries@appalachiainteractive.com](mailto:inquiries@appalachiainteractive.com) if you want to engage with what we're doing in any way.

## Responsible

We don't ignore our ethical, moral, and social responsibilities.  We take it seriously when we represent something in our work — a living being, a place, a culture.  We recognize that the elements of our world that make their way into our stories, are owed something by us.

If you want to learn about how we are repaying this debt now, and how we plan to in the future, check out our [causes](https://appalachiainteractive.com/causes).

## Accessible

We dont't cut corners on accessibility.  If you aren't able to play our games, please reach out to us at [accessibility@appalachiainteractive.com](mailto:accessibility@appalachiainteractive.com) and we will do everything we can to accomodate you.  You can read more about our accessibility efforts [here](https://appalachiainteractive.com/accessibility).

## Committed

We want to create works that deeply engages our audience.  Money is not the sole focus of our studio.  There are no ads, no micro-transactions, no pay-to-win, no subscriptions.  We're awake at night thinking about how to make our work more meaningful — not how to part our audience with their money.

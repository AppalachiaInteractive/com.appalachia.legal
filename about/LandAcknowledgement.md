Pittsburgh sits on land previously occupied for thousands of years by Native peoples, in a region the **`Onödowáʼga:`** referred to as `Dionde:gâ`.  Their history can be glimpsed by taking a look at the names of our rivers, towns, and geological features.

We do our best to offer our respect to those who lived on this land before us, and to repay them for what was taken.  You can read more about that [here](https://appalachiainteractive.com/causes/native-peoples/).

Let's revisit the description of our location above, with special attention to the languages of Native peoples:

> near the confluence of the `Monongahela`, `Allegheny`, and `Ohio` rivers, nestled in the `Appalachian` Plateau, just west of the `Allegheny` Mountains, on the western side of the `Appalachian` Mountains.

## The Three Rivers

> near the confluence of the `Monongahela`, `Allegheny`, and `Ohio` rivers

### Monongahela

The **`Unami`** word `Monongahela` means *"`falling banks`"*, in reference to the geological instability of the river's banks.

### Allegheny

From the **`Lenape/Unami`** `welhìk` (*"`good`"*) + `hane` (*"`river`"* (in compounds)).

### Ohio

From the **`Onödowáʼga:`** word `ohiːyo'`, meaning *"`good river`"*, *"`great river`"*, or *"`large creek`"*.

## Appalachia

> nestled in the `Appalachian` Plateau

`Apalachee` is a **`Muskogean`** language, related to languages like **`Chikashshanompa'`** (*Chickasaw*), **`Chahta Anumpa`** (*Choctaw*) and **`Muskogee`** (*Creek*).  The `Appalachian` place-name was recorded during the Narváez Expedition's encounter in 1528 with the **`Tocobaga`**, who spoke of a country named `Apalachen` far to the north.

The three rivers of Pittsburgh are still the life-blood of the Western Pennsylvania region, the same way they were for the Native peoples living near them.  We support multiple organizations taking care of the land we call home, but the [Western Pennsylvania Conservacy](https://waterlandlife.org/) in particular is taking take of the watershed that we drink from.

## Language Preservation

These Native languages, a critical part of the history of our land, are dying.  Please consider researching the Native peoples from your area.  They may have a language preservation or language revitalization program that is in need of your assistance.  

Here's a great example from the **`Delaware Tribe of Indians`**: the [`Lenape` Talking Dictionary](https://www.talk-lenape.org/).

## Most importantly

It's not just the languages that matter.  The people matter the most.  People growing up and living on reservations today are impacted by generations of trauma, and face a staggering amount of hardships.  If you can, consider reaching out to the Native nations from your area - either presently or historically.  Or consider a donation to a group like the [Center for Native American Youth](https://www.cnay.org).

## Beyond Land Acknowledgement

Land acknowledgement is a way to offer respect to the Native people whose ancestors lived where you are.  But it's not the only way, and by itself, it is not enough to help right our nation's wrongs.  The [Native Governance Center](https://nativegov.org/) has a great article on moving [Beyond Land Acknowledgement](https://nativegov.org/beyond-land-acknowledgment/) and on to more concrete ways to support Native communities.  You can read about our efforts to do so [here](https://appalachiainteractive.com/causes/native-peoples/).

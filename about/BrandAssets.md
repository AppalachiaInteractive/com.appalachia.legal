# Logos, Designs And Usage

Thanks for your interest in our brand's assets!  We'd love for you to use them!

Before we get to the good stuff, here's some guidelines for how to use our assets.  Please only use the assets in the manner described here.

## Usage Guidelines

### Colors

<img src="https://appalachiainteractive.com/wp-content/uploads/brand/palette.png" style="width:100%; max-height:8px; border:1px solid #fff;"/>  

We love our colors.  So we hope you'll use the versions of our designs that incorporate them.  However, if our colored designs clash with your work, you may use the monochromatic black or white versions of our designs.

#### Using the monochromatic designs

 The monochromatic versions of our designs come with a transparent background.   Please be considerate of how you overlay our designs.  For example:

- The white version should only be used over a dark background.
- The black version should only be used over a light background.

 If you are not able to seat our designs in a way that makes them clear and well-defined, please [contact us](mailto:brand@appalachiainteractive.com).  We are very committed to ensuring our brand is represented well in all mediums.

### Please contact us

- If you want to use artwork not included in this repository.
- If you want to use these images in a video or mainstream media.
- If you want to use these images in news media.

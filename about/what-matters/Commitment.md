## Commitment

We want to create works that deeply engage our audience.  Money is not the sole focus of our studio.  There are no ads, no micro-transactions, no pay-to-win, no subscriptions.  We're awake at night thinking about how to make our work more meaningful â€” not how to part our audience with their money.  Our marketing strategy is to make a product so good that you will share it with those around you.

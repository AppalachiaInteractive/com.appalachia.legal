## Independence

Appalachia Interactive is not, and does not aim to be, a traditional video game studio.  Or, for that matter, a traditional company.  We're going our own way â€” staying small, lean, and employee-owned.  

Send us a note at [inquiries@appalachiainteractive.com](mailto:inquiries@appalachiainteractive.com) if you want to engage with what we're doing in any way.

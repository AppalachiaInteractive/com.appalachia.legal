### Respect

With our work and our daily lives, we do our best to pay respect to the world around us and the living things in it.  

We acknowledge that we benefit from a national economy built on the back of theft, genocide, and slavery.  We support the [Black, Indigenous, and People of Color](https://appalachiainteractive.com/causes/bipoc/) whose ancestors helped build this nation and still are denied equal treatment and their share of our national wealth.

We also offer our respect to the [Native peoples](https://appalachiainteractive.com/causes/native-peoples/) who lived on this land before us, and to repay them for what was taken.  You can read about the land we sit on in our [land acknowledgement](https://appalachiainteractive.com/about/the-land/) and who we support and trust to [conserve it](https://appalachiainteractive.com/causes/environment/).

Last but not least, we care deeplyfor the animals that live with us on this land.  You can read about some important [animal rights](https://appalachiainteractive.com/causes/animal-rights/) issues that we support.

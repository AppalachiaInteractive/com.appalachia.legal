- `Confidential Information` includes all information identified by a disclosing `Party` as proprietary and confidential, which `Confidential Information` shall remain the sole property of the disclosing `Party` unless the ownership of such `Confidential Information` is otherwise expressly set forth in the `Agreement`.

Each `Party` agrees to safeguard the `Confidential Information` of the other `Party` against use or disclosure other than as authorized by or pursuant to this `Agreement` through measures, and exercising a degree of care, which are at least as protective as those, `Consultant` or `Appalachia Interactive`, as the case may be, exercises in safeguarding the confidentiality of its own proprietary information, but no less than a reasonable degree of care under the circumstances. Each `Party` shall permit access to the `Confidential Information` of the other `Party` only to those individuals (a) who have entered into a written nondisclosure `Agreement` with the other `Party` on terms equally as restrictive as those set forth herein, and (b) who require access in performance of their duties to the other `Party` in connection with the other `Party's` rights under this `Agreement`.

- Each `Party` acknowledges that the wrongful use or disclosure of `Confidential Information` of the other `Party` may result in irreparable harm for which there will be no adequate remedy at law. In the event of a breach by the other `Party` or any of its officers, employees or agents of its or their obligations, the non-breaching `Party` may immediately terminate this `Agreement` without liability to the other `Party`, and may bring an appropriate legal action to enjoin such breach, and shall be entitled to recover from the breaching `Party` reasonable legal fees and cost in addition to other appropriate relief.

## Warranties

- `Consultant` warrants that the `Services` to be provided under this `Agreement` shall be performed in a professional manner conforming to generally accepted industry standards and practices. `Appalachia Interactive` agrees that `Consultant's` sole and exclusive obligation with respect to the `Services` covered by this limited warranty shall be, at `Consultant's` sole discretion, to correct the nonconformity or to refund the `Service Fees` paid for the affected consulting services.

## General Provisions

- The relationship of `Appalachia Interactive` and `Consultant` is that of independent contractors. Personnel of both `Parties` are neither agents nor employees of the other `Party` for federal tax purposes or any other purpose whatsoever, and are not entitled to any employee benefits of the other `Party`.

- No delay, failure or default in performance of any obligation by either `Party`, excepting all obligations to make payments hereunder, shall constitute a breach of this `Agreement` to the extent caused by force majeure.

- Any assignment in violation of these terms is void.

- Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this `Agreement`, or the breach thereof, shall be conclusively resolved through binding arbitration under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.

Each `Party` shall bear its own costs and attorney fees, unless the arbitration award specifically provides otherwise.

- All communications between the `Parties` with respect to any of the provisions of this `Agreement` shall be in writing, and shall be sent by personal delivery or by airmail, facsimile transmission or other commercial means of rapid deliver, postage or costs of transmission and deliver prepaid, to `Appalachia Interactive` or to `Consultant` as set forth in the preamble of this `Agreement`, until such time as either `Party` provided the other not less than ten (10) days prior written notice of a change of address in accordance with these provisions.

- The validity of this `Agreement` and the rights, obligations and relations of the `Parties` hereunder shall be construed and determined under and in accordance with the laws of the State of Pennsylvania; provided, however, that if any provision of the `Agreement` is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of any applicable law or otherwise invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall to such extent as it shall be determined to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under such law be deemed null and void, but this `Agreement` shall otherwise remain in full force. After arbitration, any suit to enforce any provision of this `Agreement`, or any right, remedy or other matter arising from the arbitration, will be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Pennsylvania. `Consultant` and `Appalachia Interactive` agree and consent to the venue in and to the in person jurisdiction of the aforementioned courts.

- Any modification or amendment of any provision of this `Agreement` must be in writing and bear the signature of the duly authorized representatives of both `Parties`. The failure of any `Party` to enforce any right it is granted herein, or to require the performance by the other `Party` hereto of any provision of this `Agreement`, or the waiver by any `Party` of any breach of this `Agreement`, shall not prevent a subsequent exercise or enforcement of such provisions or be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach of this `Agreement`. All provisions of this `Agreement` which by their own terms take effect upon the termination of this `Agreement` or by their nature survive termination shall survive such termination.

- This `Agreement`, all attached schedules and all other `Agreement's` referred to herein or to be delivered by the `Parties` pursuant hereto, represents the entire understanding and `Agreement` between the `Parties` with respect to the subject matter hereof, and merges all prior discussions between them and supersedes and replaces any and every other `Agreement` or understanding which may have existed between the `Parties` to the extent that any such `Agreement` or understanding relates to providing `Services` to `Appalachia Interactive`. `Appalachia Interactive` hereby acknowledges that it has not reasonable relied on any other representation or statement that is not contained in this `Agreement` or made by a person or entity other than `Consultant`. To the extent, it any, that the terms and conditions of `Appalachia Interactive's` orders or other correspondence are inconsistent with this `Agreement`, this `Agreement` shall control.

IN WITNESS WHEROF, the `Parties` hereto have caused this `Agreement` to be executed by their duly authorized representatives as of the `Agreement Date` first above written.

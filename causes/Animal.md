# Animal Rights

> Until we have the courage to recognize cruelty for what it is — whether its victim is human or animal — we cannot exepct things to be much better in this world.

## Why it matters to us

We believe that animals are not "ours" to do with as we please, and that as humans we should use our intelligence and resources to protect the animals around us, especially from the side-effects of our modern lifestyles.

## Who we support

Individually, we are financially contributing to the following organizations:

### [Humane Society of the United States](https://www.humanesociety.org/)

Together with millions of supporters, the Humane Society of the United States takes on puppy mills, factory farms, the fur trade, trophy hunting, animal cosmetics testing and other cruel industries. We rescue and care for thousands of animals every year through our rescue and response team and other hands-on animal care services. We fight all forms of animal cruelty to achieve the vision behind our name: a humane society.

### [Farm Sanctuary](https://www.farmsanctuary.org)

Farm Sanctuary was founded in 1986 to combat the abuses of factory farming, advocate for institutional reforms, and encourage a new awareness and understanding of farm animals and the benefits of cruelty-free, plant-based living. In recent years, science has confirmed the inhumane and destructive impact of animal agriculture — a food system based on interrelated oppression and injustice.

### [Great Ape Project](https://www.projetogap.org.br/en/)

The Great Ape Project, or GAP, is an international movement created in 1994 whose main purpose is to fight for the basic rights to life, freedom and non-torture of the nonhuman great apes – Chimpanzees, Gorillas, Orangutans and Bonobos, the closest relatives of man in the animal world.

### [PETA](https://peta.org)

PETA was founded in 1980 and is dedicated to establishing and defending the rights of all animals. PETA operates under the simple principle that animals are not ours to experiment on, eat, wear, use for entertainment, or abuse in any other way. PETA educates policymakers and the public about animal abuse and promotes kind treatment of animals. PETA is an international nonprofit charitable organization based in Norfolk, Virginia, with affiliates worldwide.

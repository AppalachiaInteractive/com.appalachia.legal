# Black, Indigenous, People of Color

> The beauty of anti-racism is that you don’t have to pretend to be free of racism to be an anti-racist. Anti-racism is the commitment to fight racism wherever you find it, including in yourself. And it’s the only way forward.

## Why it matters to us

We were educated on the idea of the great American "melting pot" — all of the world's people welcome to join the post-racial utopia of the United States.  When we look at the anti-minority and anti-immigrant sentiment in American today, it is easy to see that the utopia never existed.  

Millions of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color have shared common history in the United States — inequality, forced assimilation, slavery, and genocide.  The result of these has been a prosperous and comfotable society for a middle and uppoer-class, predominantly white American society.  

To the extent that we have prospered from taking part in that economy, we believe that we have a responsibility to invest in BIPOC communities.  We also believe that until there is equality for all, we must do our part to support the efforts of those working every day to achieve it.

## Who we support

To start with, individually, we are financially contributing to the following organizations:

### [The BIPOC Project](https://www.thebipocproject.org/)

The BIPOC Project aims to build authentic and lasting solidarity among Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC), in order to undo Native invisibility, anti-Blackness, dismantle white supremacy and advance racial justice.  We use the term BIPOC to highlight the unique relationship to whiteness that Indigenous and Black (African Americans) people have, which shapes the experiences of and relationship to white supremacy for all people of color within a U.S. context. We unapologetically focus on and center relationships among BIPOC folks.

### [1Hood](https://www.1hood.org/)

1Hood is an art and activist collective providing Pittsburghers with the resources to make change in their community. This organization uses art to bring a greater awareness towards racial injustices happening in Pittsburgh and around the nation.

### [American Civil Liberties Union](https://www.lenape-nation.org)

The American Civil Liberties Union is our nation's guardian of liberty, working daily in courts, legislatures and communities to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties that the Constitution and laws of the United States guarantee everyone in this country.

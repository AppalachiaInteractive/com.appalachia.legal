We want to leave the world a better place than we found it.  Here's how we're trying to do that:

## Today

- ### [Native Peoples](https://appalachiainteractive.com/causes/native-peoples)

- ### [Environmental Conservation](https://appalachiainteractive.com/causes/environment)

- ### [Animal Rights](https://appalachiainteractive.com/causes/animals)

## The Future

As Appalachia Interactive grows into profitability, we intend to steadily increase financial support for these causes, and more, at the studio level.  

It's still too early, with too much unknown, for us to give specifics about our giving goals.  But we hope that in reading these pages, you will get a sense of who we are, and how committed we are to sharing what we have to make the world better.

Please let us know of any organizations needing our support.  Reach us at [giving@appapachiainteractive.com](mailto:giving@appalachiainteractive.com).

# Environmental Causes

> Saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, advancing economic growth… these are one and the same fight. We must connect the dots between climate change, water scarcity, energy shortages, global health, food security and women’s empowerment. Solutions to one problem must be solutions for all.

## Why it matters to us

We are passionate lovers of nature, and supportors of environmental and conservation efforts.

But beyond just environmental concern, we believe that the history of this American land - the genocide and expulsion of native peoples - has put those of us inhabiting this land into an even greater debt.  

This land was taken illegally and violently.  Now, we who inhabit it must care for it and find ways to make amends to the ancestors of those who suffered.  You can read more about how Appalachia Interactive is trying to pay back its debt to native peoples [here](https://appalachiainteractive.com/causes/native-peoples).

## Who we support

Regarding environmental issues, we are financially contributing individually to the following organizations:

- ### [Western Pennsylvania Conservancy](https://waterlandlife.org/)

  The Western Pennsylvania Conservancy has been dedicated to protecting and restoring the region’s exceptional natural places since 1932. As a member-based nonprofit organization, we work in cities and towns across Western Pennsylvania and rely on the help of thousands of members, partners and volunteers. We are making a difference in our region’s water, land and life. We do this work for the wildlife and people who call Western Pennsylvania home.

- ### [Pennsylvania Parks and Forests Foundation](https://paparksandforests.org)

  Pennsylvania Parks and Forests Foundation (PPFF) began in 1999 as a statewide nonprofit organization to provide a voice for the Commonwealth’s 121 state parks and 2.2 million acres of forest land.

- ### [Pennsylvnia Environmental Council](https://pecpa.org/)

  The Pennsylvania Environmental Council (PEC) protects and restores the natural and built environments through innovation, collaboration, education and advocacy. PEC believes in the value of partnerships with the private sector, government, communities and individuals to improve the quality of life for all Pennsylvanians.

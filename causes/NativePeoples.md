# Native Peoples

> Before any final solution to American history can occur, a reconciliation must be effected between the spiritual owner of the land — American Indians — and the political owner of the land — American Whites. Guilt and accusations cannot continue to revolve in a vacuum without some effort at reaching a solution.

## Why it matters to us

We believe that Native peoples are owed for the loss of land, life and future that resulted from the European settlement of the Americas.  We have benefitted from this theft, and we intend to do our part to repay that debt.

Further, we have a deep appreciation and interest in Native culture and lifestyles.  When we tell stories that drawn on Native cultures and histories, we only increase that debt.

We acknowledge that debt.  Our intent is to not simply repay it, but to be a significant net-positive for as many Native communities as we can be.

## Who we support

**While *Keepers Of Creation* is our flagship product, we intend for Native causes to receive the biggest investment across all of our causes.  We intend to steadily grow our support of these communities, to include Native artists and designers, students, nations, activist efforts and more.**

To start with, individually, we are financially contributing to the following organizations:

### [Lenape Nation of Pennsylvania](https://www.lenape-nation.org)

The Lenape Nation of Pennsylvania is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to increasing awareness of Lenape history and culture. Created to join together the members of the Lenape Nation and anyone else interested in continuing the development of the language and culture of the Lenape people, the Lenape Nation of Pennsylvania is active in the revival of tradition and community. We encourage partnerships among people and organizations in order to foster cultural, historical, and environmental education and preservation.

### [Center for Native American Youth](https://www.cnay.org)

The Center for Native American Youth (CNAY) at the Aspen Institute is a national education and advocacy organization that works alongside Native youth—ages 24 and under—on reservations, in rural villages and urban spaces across the country to improve their health, safety, and overall well- being. All Native youth deserve to lead full and healthy lives, have equal access to opportunity, draw strength from Native culture, and inspire one another. At CNAY, this is achieved through empowerment and culturally-competent methodologies that include leadership, youth-led policy agenda, and youth-led narrative.

### [Indian Land Tenure Foundation](https://iltf.org)

The Indian Land Tenure Foundation (ILTF) is a national, community-based organization serving American Indian nations and people in the recovery and control of their rightful homelands. We work to promote education, increase cultural awareness, create economic opportunity, and reform the legal and administrative systems that prevent Indian people from owning and controlling reservation lands.

### [Lessons Of Our Land](https://www.lessonsofourland.org)

Lessons of Our Land teaches the Native American story of this land from historical to modern times. The nonprofit Indian Land Tenure Foundation (ILTF) developed the curriculum to provide both Native and non-Native students with broader insight and understanding of land, cultures, inherent rights and tribal sovereignty. The larger goal is to have children and adults identify with the land they live on and be better prepared to solve the difficult issues that impact communities on or near reservations today.

### [Tribal Extension](https://tribalextension.org/)

The Federally Recognized Tribal Extension Program supports Native American farmers, ranchers and youth through community outreach and practical programming across Indian Country.

### [Native Governance Center](https://nativegov.org/)

Native Governance Center is a Native-led nonprofit organization that serves Native nations in Mni Sota Makoce, North Dakota, and South Dakota. We support Native leaders as they work to rebuild their nations through our leadership development and Tribal governance support programs. We believe that strengthening governance is a direct pathway toward improving quality of life for Native people.

## The Future

**This list will continue to grow.**

*As Appalachia Interactive grows into profitability, we intend to financially support these organizations, and more, at the studio level.  Please let us know of any organizations needing our support.  Reach us at [giving@appapachiainteractive.com](mailto:giving@appalachiainteractive.com).*

# Native American Causes

> Before any final solution to American history can occur, a reconciliation must be effected between the spiritual owner of the land - American Indians - and the political owner of the land - American Whites. Guilt and accusations cannot continue to revolve in a vacuum without some effort at reaching a solution.

## Why it matters to us

We believe that the native peoples of America are owed for the loss of land, life and future that resulted from the European settlement of the Americas.  We have benefitted from this theft, and we intend to do our part to repay that debt.

Further, we have a deep appreciation and interest in native culture and lifestyles.  When we tell stories that drawn on native cultures and histories, we only increase that debt.

We acknowledge that debt.  Our intent is to not simply repay it, but to be a significant net-positive for as many native communities as we can be.

## Who we support

**While *Keepers of Creation* is our flagship product, we intend for Native American causes to receive the biggest investment across all of our causes.  We intend to steadily grow our support of these communities, to include native artists and designers, students, tribes and nations, activist efforts and more.**

To start with, individually, we are financially contributing to the following organizations:

- ### [Indian Land Tenure Foundation](https://iltf.org)

  The Indian Land Tenure Foundation (ILTF) is a national, community-based organization serving American Indian nations and people in the recovery and control of their rightful homelands. We work to promote education, increase cultural awareness, create economic opportunity, and reform the legal and administrative systems that prevent Indian people from owning and controlling reservation lands.

- ### [Lessons Of Our Land](https://www.lessonsofourland.org)

  Lessons of Our Land teaches the Native American story of this land from historical to modern times. The nonprofit Indian Land Tenure Foundation (ILTF) developed the curriculum to provide both Native and non-Native students with broader insight and understanding of land, cultures, inherent rights and tribal sovereignty. The larger goal is to have children and adults identify with the land they live on and be better prepared to solve the difficult issues that impact communities on or near reservations today.

- ### [Tribal Extension](https://tribalextension.org/)

  The Federally Recognized Tribal Extension Program supports Native American farmers, ranchers and youth through community outreach and practical programming across Indian Country.

## The Future

**This list will continue to grow.**

*As Appalachia Interactive grows into profitability, we intend to financially support these organizations, and more, at the studio level.  Please let us know of any organizations needing our support.  Reach us at [giving@appapachiainteractive.com](mailto:giving@appalachiainteractive.com).*

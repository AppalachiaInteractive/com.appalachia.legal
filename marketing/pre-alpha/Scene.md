The crackling fire warms you as shadows dance across the cavern walls.  Outside, lightning flashes across the night sky.

The rain forced you to shelter, but has also covered your tracks and scent.  Exhausted, you start to tend your wounds.

As you peer out into the darkness, the light from the fire catches for a brief moment on two shimmering eyes.  Something stirs, deeper in the cave.

You leap to your feet, hand already reaching for your blade.

Breathing behind you.  Not alone.

The crackling fire warms you as shadows dance across the cavern walls.  Outside, lightning flashes across the night sky.

The rain forced you to take shelter, but it also has covered your tracks and scent.  Letting out a deep breath, you finally can relax enough to tend to your wounds.

As you peer out into the darkness, the light from the fire catches for a brief moment on two shimmering eyes.  Something shifts from deeper in the cave.

You leap to your feet, hand already on your reaching for your blade.

Breathing behind you.  Not alone.
